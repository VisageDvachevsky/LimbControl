My application is designed to assist individuals with musculoskeletal injuries in their recovery process. Users can upload their own exercise videos and utilize the built-in calendar feature to track and record their exercise repetitions accurately. The calendar allows users to monitor their progress and maintain a log of their exercise sessions. While my application focuses on providing a platform for users to organize their exercise videos and track their daily exercise routines, it does not offer automated feedback or monitoring of exercise performance.
